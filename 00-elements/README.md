This is an unique deck of visual archetypes written in GLSL Shader Language. It unfold in a continuum that goes from simplicity to complexity, from darkness to light.

**Learn**: The cards are presented as a progression. Sort them according the numbers on their back. Starting with the one with lower value read the code on their back... imagine what it does... pass to the next one only when the meaning is clear, and match what you envision.

**Library**: a long the progression different functions are defined (only once) and reused, making this deck on an incarnated library of visual algorithms. 

**Oracle**: Find a quiet space. Take your time to define an intention in a sentence or a question. Check with your self and adjust the words until it feels right. Take a card with your left hand. Turn the front up, so you can see it clearly. Meditate on the meaning. If you the intention or question change, repeat until a dialog emerge.
